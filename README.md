# StaticElasticConstants
The script can be used to find the static elastic constant of the solid material in UCS and Triaxial tests

- Inputs are the axial and lateral displacements (deformation not the strain) recorded by the gauges or LVDTs
- Deformation units in mills (1 mil = 0.001 in)

- Outputs: Young's modulus of elasticity, shear modulus, bulk moduluis, poisson ratio
- 50% tangent method is used to find the moduli
